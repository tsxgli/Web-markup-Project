            Santorini is known for its white historic looking buildings and its
            view of the ocean. This place looks different than other vacation
            spots, mainly because it has no tropics. But those things are what
            makes Santorini special compared most vacation spots. Santorini is
            located in the southern Aegan sea, one of the Cyclade islands and
            its considered one of the most beautiful greek islands. Its also a
            perfect honeymoon vacation place because of the good sunny weather
            and the other places to go.
